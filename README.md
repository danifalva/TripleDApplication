# TripleDApplication
This is an application that displays all the eateries visited by Guy Fieri in the Food Network show "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives". The program parses the data from a google map which is actively updated to include places from the new seasons. The app is separated into three separate sections which are the following, Near Me, All Restaurants, and Just Diners. The near me section displays all locations closest to the user that is either 25 or 50 miles away. Once a place is selected the name of the eartery is displayed as well as the episode it appeared on. A map is also included with a pin that allows you to press it in order to get directions by opening up the Apple Maps application.
